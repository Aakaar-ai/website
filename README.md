To deploy your app to Netlify and implement **"Login with Amazon"** with a Node.js backend, here's the proper setup:

---

### **1. Understand the Deployment Structure**
Netlify primarily serves static files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). If you want to use a Node.js server for dynamic backend logic (like OAuth token exchange), you'll need to deploy it separately (e.g., to **AWS Lambda** or **Netlify Functions**).

Here’s how you can split the responsibilities:

- **Static HTML Pages**: Serve directly via Netlify.
- **Node.js Backend**: Deploy as a serverless function or to a service like **Render**, **Heroku**, or **AWS Lambda**.

---

### **2. Serving Static HTML Files via Netlify**
1. **Project Structure**:
   ```
   /public
     ├── index.html
     ├── other.html
     ├── amazon.html
   /functions
     ├── server.js (your Node.js backend logic)
   netlify.toml
   ```

2. **Netlify Deployment**:
   - Place all your HTML files in the `/public` directory.
   - In the `netlify.toml` file, configure the public directory:
     ```toml
     [build]
     publish = "public"
     functions = "functions"
     ```

   - Move your `server.js` code to the `/functions` directory (and adapt it for serverless deployment, as explained below).

3. **Netlify Functions Setup**:
   - Modify your `server.js` to work as a serverless function:
     ```javascript
     const axios = require('axios');

     exports.handler = async (event) => {
       if (event.httpMethod !== 'GET') {
         return {
           statusCode: 405,
           body: 'Method Not Allowed',
         };
       }

       const code = event.queryStringParameters.code;

       if (!code) {
         return {
           statusCode: 400,
           body: 'Authorization code is missing',
         };
       }

       try {
         const tokenResponse = await axios.post(
           'https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token',
           new URLSearchParams({
             grant_type: 'authorization_code',
             code: code,
             client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
             client_secret: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
             redirect_uri: 'https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/callback',
           }),
           {
             headers: {
               'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
             },
           }
         );

         const { access_token } = tokenResponse.data;

         const profileResponse = await axios.get('https://api.amazon.com/user/profile', {
           headers: {
             Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,
           },
         });

         return {
           statusCode: 200,
           body: JSON.stringify(profileResponse.data),
         };
       } catch (error) {
         console.error(error.response?.data || error.message);
         return {
           statusCode: 500,
           body: 'Internal Server Error',
         };
       }
     };
     ```

4. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
   - Connect your repository to Netlify.
   - Netlify will automatically deploy your static files and handle serverless functions.

---

### **3. Should HTML Pages Be Served via Node.js?**
No, it's unnecessary and not ideal in this setup. **Netlify** can serve static HTML files directly from its CDN, which is faster and more reliable than routing them through a Node.js server.

---

### **4. Workflow Overview**
1. The static HTML pages are served directly by **Netlify**.
2. The Node.js backend for OAuth is handled as a serverless function deployed in the `/functions` directory.
3. Amazon's login redirect (to `/callback`) is processed by the serverless function.

---

### **5. Redirect URI**
Make sure you update the redirect URI in Amazon Developer Console to:
```
https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server
```

---

### **6. Benefits of This Approach**
- **Speed**: Static files are served via CDN.
- **Scalability**: Backend logic is offloaded to serverless functions.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and backend logic are independent.
